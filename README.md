# Project_Plagiarism_Detection.
In this project, I was tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labelling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.
